        I mostly work with C++, backend systems, and DevOps. I&apos;m also learning cybersecurity (basic stuff like MITM attacks and Wi-Fi hacking), Web3, and AI/ML.

        I like building things that are actually useful for developers in real life â€” tools, automations, or anything that makes workflows easier. Still learning, still experimenting.
